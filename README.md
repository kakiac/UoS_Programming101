This module will introduce the concepts of programming and a modern programming language. Although it is likely that the majority of students will have some programming experience, none will be assumed. Structured programming constructs, procedural programming and object-oriented programming will be covered. Elements of agile development will be covered. 

The aims of the module are: 

 * to introduce the concept of a computer program, programming languages and program production methods; 
 * to introduce generic high-level programming language concepts; 
 * to introduce the concepts and structures of structured programming; 
 * to introduce the concepts of object-oriented development and programming; 
 * to introduce the concepts of Agile Development.

 * Editing a Java program (including tools such as: colour coding, autofilling, saving/exporting eclipse project, workspace)
 * Compiling a Java Program
 * Running a Java program
 * Help! There is an error (a first look at understanding compiler error messages)
 * Your turn: 
    * Running lecture2-1.java; replace numbers with a variable
    * Correcting the mistakes in lecture2-2.java & sucessfully running it

#### Lecture 3: Java concepts II: String Operators & Other data types
